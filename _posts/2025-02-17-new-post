# Applied Mathematics Platform  

## Introduction  

The **Applied Mathematics Platform** is an open-source initiative that brings the power of **Haskell** to computational mathematics and scientific computing. It provides **domain-specific languages (DSLs) and high-performance libraries** to solve problems in **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Analysis (FEA), optimization, and more**.  

By leveraging the expressiveness of **functional programming**, this platform aims to provide **clear, efficient, and mathematically rigorous** solutions for researchers, engineers, and developers.  

## Core Philosophy  

The platform is based on the idea that **functional programming**, particularly **Haskell**, offers a more expressive, reliable, and scalable foundation for scientific computing. Key principles include:  

- **Declarative Abstractions** – Write solvers and simulations in a high-level, math-like notation.  
- **Modularity & Composability** – Components can be easily extended, reused, and combined for various applications.  
- **Type-Safety & Correctness** – Haskell’s strong type system ensures **mathematical rigor** and reduces runtime errors.  

## Key Components  

The platform will consist of:  

- **Embedded DSLs (eDSLs):** Haskell-based DSLs for modeling, simulating, and analyzing engineering and optimization problems.  
- **Standalone DSLs:** Beginner-friendly domain-specific languages for users who are not familiar with Haskell but need powerful mathematical tools.  
- **Library Suite:** A collection of Haskell libraries implementing numerical methods, solvers, and data processing utilities.  

## Domains of Application  

The platform will support a variety of computational and engineering domains, including:  

1. **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** – Solvers for Navier-Stokes equations, turbulence modeling, and aerodynamic simulations.  
2. **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** – Frameworks for structural analysis, heat transfer, and other engineering applications.  
3. **Optimization & Control** – Tools for mathematical optimization, machine learning, and control systems.  
4. **Symbolic & Numeric Computation** – Support for algebraic manipulation, differential equations, and numerical integration.  

## Roadmap  

### Phase 1: Open-Source Release  
- Develop core libraries and DSLs.  
- Host the platform on GitHub Pages.  
- Publish tutorials and documentation.  

### Phase 2: Adoption & Research Collaborations  
- Engage with academia and industry experts.  
- Publish research papers.  
- Attract contributors and funding.  

### Phase 3: Commercialization & Business Model  
- Provide consulting and enterprise solutions.  
- Develop SaaS-based computational tools.  
- Expand industry partnerships.  

## Stay Tuned  

The **Applied Mathematics Platform** is in its early stages, with a focus on open-source development. As it matures, it will evolve into a powerful ecosystem for scientific computing.
